# Shortcuts
Setting up &amp; saving shortcut settings for various IDE's such as Visual Studio, Visual Code, Android Studio. This way they all match &amp; can be easily imported if lost

## Visual Studio  
`Tools` -> `Import and Export Settings` -> Import/Export 'Keyboard' only.   
My Keyboard bindings are saved to `CurrentSettings.vssettings` in this project  

### Tips  
Search by key: Assign a shortcut and look inside "Shortcut currently used by" field.
